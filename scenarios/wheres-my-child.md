# Where's my child?!
> Check-in and monitoring system for parents with kids in activities

Families love TUI holidays as there is always a rich offering for kids entertainment and activities, so much in fact, that some parents have no idea where there is until they return! For peace of mind, you have been asked to create a check-in and monitoring system for the child's parent.

Features include:
- Ability to sign in a child to a particular activity
- An activity leader is responsible for monitoring the child, and therefore, we can assume that anywhere the leader goes the child does too. Alternatively, should you wish for the child to wear a wristband or some other geo-location tracking device, that could also work too
- Whilst the activity is taking place, the parent will know exactly where the child is, a map and location details will be displayed
- Ability for the activity leader to change the location or activity based on the day's itenerary, eg, little Steve has just finished archery in quad, now the group are walking to adventure playground
- The parent can subscribe to notifications based on their child's movement and actvity changes
- One parent can have more than one child
- Should there be an accident or any difficulties, the activity leader can request that the parent comes to get the child
- Ability to sign the child out of an activity
