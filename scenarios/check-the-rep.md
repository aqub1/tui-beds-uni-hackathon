# Check the rep
> Effective communication between customers and their holiday rep

Many of our customers have fed up that our holiday reps aren't always available, accessible or not in the location they expect them to be.

Our rep team completed some market research and want to meet the following key points:
- Customers able to see a timetable and the meeting points for the reps on duty
- Customers can contact the rep through a chat system
- Customer to be able to search through some previously answered FAQs about the resort, surrounding area and other holiday related questions
- Customers can locate the on-duty rep on a map in order to find them
- Reps are able to edit answer some chat questions and add the answers to the FAQs section

You have been asked to create an app that meets some of these criteria.
