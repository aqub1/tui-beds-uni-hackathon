> A digital art piece showcasing the live bookings made by TUI customers all over the world

Customers in the TUI resorts are often queueing up at the end of their holiday to book their next one with the rep. One of the customers said that `it would be nice to see where in world other people are going so I can think about going there too!`.

The head office team said that they have a live feed of all of the booking orders that take place, and have been asked you to create an live map showing all of the bookings in real time. This will then to shown on a TV screen in the rep offices across the world.
