> A digital art piece showcasing the live bookings made by TUI customers all over the world

Customers in TUI resorts are often queueing up at the end of their holiday to book their holiday with the rep. One of the customers said that `it would be nice to see where in world other people are going so I can think about going there too!`.

The head office team have a live feed of all of the bookings that are currently taking place, and have asked you to create a live map showing all of the bookings in real time. This will be shown on a TV screen in the rep offices across the world.

You have been asked to create this interactive art piece.
