> Identifying photos of beetles so that customers can find the most elusive and rare specimens

TUI resort locations around the world have some of the most amazing, varied and unique flora and fauna. A recent sighting of the `lesser spotted red-arsed beetle` has prompted a rush of bug-enthusiasts to book tickets to Hawaii, the only known location of this rare creature.

Keen to come to the assistance of these anthropodic-adventurers, one of the TUI directors has requested that you create a program that identifies beetles based off of photographs taken of them so that customers can brag about all of the elusive wildlife that they have spotted!

Maybe this could even be gamified to encourage others to join...
