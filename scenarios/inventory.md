# Inventory

TUI have an in-resort app that can be downloaded by its customers.  This app allows our customers to book and pay for any of the additional services and products we offer at our hotels.

Here is a sample of some products:

```bash
Code | Name                                    | Price   | Availability
-----|-----------------------------------------|---------|-------------
0001 | Taxi Transfer - Airport to Hotel Return | £100.00 | Unlimited
0002 | Baby Cot Hire - 7 Days                  | £80.00  | 10
0003 | Car Hire - 7 Days                       | £125.00 | 10
0004 | Attraction Ticket - Per Person          | £50.00  | Unlimited
0005 | Wedding                                 | £400.00 | 7
0006 | Excursion - Per Person                  | £40.00  | Unlimited
0007 | Sunbed Hire - 7 Days                    | £100.00 | 100
```

As you can see - not all products and services are unlimited - availability is restricted.

As a customer uses the in-resort app - the availability of the various products and services needs to be updated in real time.  So that if a product or service is no longer available this is indicated to the customer and they can no longer add that product/service to the in app basket.  This can happen at any time.

When a customer successfully check's out within the app - availability is reduced accordingly.  Also, in real time.  However, you need to check the availability of each product/service in the customers basket at checkout.  If any of the products/services the customer has chosen is no longer available, you need to alert the customer and cancel the checkout process.

As customers return home, or their hire duration/wedding has ended - and the product/service is returned - the availability of each product/service needs updating at this point (in real time).  Again, this can happen at any time.

You have been asked to implement an inventory service for the above description.  It needs to include the app and the inventory service and should use a RabbitMQ, Redis or AWS SQS event messaging element to communicate between the two.
