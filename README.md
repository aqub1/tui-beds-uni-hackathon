## The Hackathon

The theme for this years TUI / Bedforshire University hackathon will be `In-Resort Experience`.  In other words - based around the kinds of services and products that TUI - our in-resort suppliers and partners - supply to its customers while actually on holiday.

For several of this years scenarios you will need the following data.  Whilst this is typical of the kinds of in-resort ad-hoc products TUI offer (we call them ancillaries) - this has been simplied and limited.  In particular the pricing scheme is significantly more complex that the those shown below.  Prices given are for illustration only - they are not actual values.  The availability given is based on per resort.
