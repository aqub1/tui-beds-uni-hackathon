## The Hackathon

The theme for this years TUI / Bedforshire University hackathon will be `In-Resort Experience`.  In other words - based around the kinds of services and products that TUI - our in-resort suppliers and partners - supply to its customers while actually on holiday.

For several of this years scenarios you will need the following data.  Whilst this is typical of the kinds of in-resort ad-hoc products TUI offer (we call them ancillaries) - this list has been simplified and significantly reduced.  In particular, the pricing scheme considerably more complex that shown below.  

Prices given are for illustration only - they are not actual values.  

The availability given is based on per resort.

This years hackathon is 1 day (24 hours) in length, so the scenarios have been reduced to reflect the duration available.  However, for those adventerous, brilliant, or plain crazy enough - the following scenarios are designed so they can be combined together: checkout + inventory, inventory + payment, or even checkout + inventory + payment!  Another option is for multiple teams to work together on all 3 of these scanarios, providing a seemless integration between them and offer a single - unified - solution.

As always - the choice of scenario(s), tools, testing & design techniques and language(s) is yours.  

It is perfectly acceptable (even desirable) for some of the elements in your solution to be 'faked', for example: the 'app' mentioned throughout could be a simple command line program, user interactions could be randomised to simulate actual situations and so on.

Happy hacking!
