* Small number (4-6) well-chosen scenarios
* All 'external' resources must be supplied
* Tech assumptions...?  TODO

* Preferably, scenarios should be doable on any platform (mobile, app, web etc)


## Scenarios

* Something using an API
* Something event-based
* Something web-based - build site from data or database
* Search (maybe no. 1 above, e.g. search for holiday, availability, hold/release cycle - algorithm)
