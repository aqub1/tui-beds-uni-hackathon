# TUI &amp; Bedfordshire University Hackathon 2018

The theme for this years TUI / Bedfordshire University hackathon is `In-Resort Experience`.  In other words - based around the kinds of services and products that TUI - its in-resort suppliers and partners - supply to its customers while they are actually on holiday.

For several of this years scenarios - you will need the data shown in the table below.  Whilst this is typical of the kinds of in-resort products & services TUI offer (known as ancillaries) - this list has been significantly simplified and reduced.  In particular, the pricing scheme below bears no relation to the one actually in use at TUI.

Prices given here are for illustration purposes only - they do not reflect actual values.  

The availability given (how many are available to the customer) is based on a per hotel basis.

### In-Resort Ancillaries

```bash
Code | Name                                    | Price   | Availability
-----|-----------------------------------------|---------|-------------
0001 | Taxi Transfer - Airport to Hotel Return | £100.00 | Unlimited
0002 | Baby Cot Hire - 7 Days                  | £80.00  | 10
0003 | Car Hire - 7 Days                       | £25.00  | 10
0004 | Attraction Ticket - Per Person          | £50.00  | Unlimited
0005 | Wedding                                 | £400.00 | 7
0006 | Excursion - Per Person                  | £40.00  | Unlimited
0007 | Sunbed Hire - 7 Days                    | £100.00 | 100
```

As this years hackathon is 1 day (24 hours) in length, the complexity of the scenarios has been reduced accordingly to reflect this change.  

For those adventurous, talented, exceptional, or plain crazy - the following scenarios are designed so they can be combined together:

* checkout + inventory
* inventory + payment
* checkout + inventory + payment

Another option is for multiple teams to work together on all 3 of these scenarios, providing a seamless integration between them and offer a single - unified - solution.

As always - the choice of scenario(s), tools, testing & design techniques and language(s) is left to each team.  

It is perfectly acceptable (even desirable) for some of the elements in your solution to be 'faked', for example: the 'app' mentioned throughout could be a simple command line program, user interactions could be randomised to simulate actual situations and so on.

Happy hacking!
